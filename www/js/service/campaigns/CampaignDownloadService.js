         * PhoneGap – the engine is so restrictive that when encountering the word
         * ‘default’, used within the prompt’s XML configuration file as a property
         * storing the default value, it interprets it as a keyword crashing the
         * system. This renders the XML2JSON conversion impossible. The only
         * solution I currently found was to replace all ‘default’  parameters within
         * the XML string to ‘def’ prior to converting to JSON. I am assuming the
         * problem is from the XML2JSON plugin’s use of the dot operator instead of
         * the array-access syntax to do the parsing, but debugging the plugin is
         * not working – there are only two xml->json parsers and I have tested
         * both. Everything works fine on the desktop side, but once placed within
         * PhoneGap the bug comes up.
         * See GitHub issue #151 for more details.
         *
         * We also had to remove multi-line comments before parsing the XML into
         * JSON - see issue #220.
